  # This is to make players' regeneration act mostly like it did in pre-1.9
  # Based on https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hunger?oldid=948685
  # How often a player should regenerate health, in milliseconds (In 1.8: 4 seconds)

  # Whether to introduce randomness in the calculation, as in 1.8

# SWEEP, SHIELDS & BLOCKING
# ########################

shield-damage-reduction:
  # This module allows changing the damage reduction behaviour of shields
  # How much damage blocking should reduce
  # Firstly, amount is subtracted, then value is multiplied by percentage
  # 1.8: (damage - 1) * 50%    1.9: damage * 33%   1.11: damage * 0%
  # Damage reduction = (damage - damageReductionAmount) * damageReductionPercentage / 100
  generalDamageReductionAmount: 1

  # This value works the same but is exclusively for projectile damage
  # Set amount to 0 and percentage to 100 for 1.8 behaviour, i.e. arrows go through shields
  projectileDamageReductionAmount: 1
  projectileDamageReductionPercentage: 50

sword-blocking:
  # This is to allow players to block with swords again, by getting a shield while they hold right click with a sword
  # How often, in ticks, OCM should check if the player is still blocking with a shield, and remove it if not
  # If this is too fast, the player will have their shield disappear before they're able to block again causing a slight delay
  # If this is too slow, players will have a shield in their hand well after they've stopped blocking
  # 20 ticks = 1 second
  restoreDelay: 40
  # Whether to require players to have oldcombatmechanics.swordblock permission to block with a sword

# ########################
# KNOCKBACK
# ########################

old-player-knockback:
  # This is to change knockback players receive from attacks.  Default values are as in 1.8.
  #
  # Practice servers tend to use lower knockback, for example:
  # knockback-horizontal: 0.35
  # knockback-vertical: 0.35
  # knockback-vertical-limit: 0.4
  # knockback-extra-horizontal: 0.425
  # knockback-extra-vertical: 0.085
  #
  # Minigame servers use higher vertical knockback and lower horizontal knockback, exact values are unknown.
  # Horizontal knockback is reduced by 40% for every successful attack by the player, with no limit
  # Increase to make clicking more important, decrease to make it less important
  knockback-horizontal: 0.4
  # Vertical knockback is not reduced by clicking faster
  # Increase to make clicking less important, decrease to make clicking more important
  knockback-vertical: 0.4
  # Vertical knockback limit is applied after base vertical knockback
  # This limit can be exceeded by sprint hitting or knockback enchantments, from the extra vertical knockback
  knockback-vertical-limit: 0.4
  # Extra horizontal knockback is applied for each level of knockback enchant, and for sprinting
  # Increase to make sprint resetting (w-tapping) more important, decrease to make it less important
  # Increase to make clicking more important, decrease to make clicking less important
  knockback-extra-horizontal: 0.5
  # Extra vertical knockback is applied for each level of knockback enchant, and for sprinting
  # Increase to make sprint resetting (w-tapping) more important, decrease to make it less important
  # Increase to make clicking less important, decrease to make clicking more important
  knockback-extra-vertical: 0.1
  # Should knockback resistance be enabled? (e.g. netherite armour knockback resistance)
  enable-knockback-resistance: false

old-fishing-knockback:
  # This is to make the knockback of players when they get hit by a fishing bobber the same as it was in pre-1.9
  # This is the damage done by the fishing rod attack
  damage: 0.0001
  # This is to cancel dragging in the entity attached to the fishing rod when reeling in, like in 1.8
  # Options: all, players, mobs, none. players allows compatibility with WorldGuard pvp-deny regions
  cancelDraggingIn: players
  # Whether to also give knockback on non-player living entities (e.g. mobs)
  knockbackNonPlayerEntities: false
  # This is the delay in milliseconds in-between rod damage, so the player hit has time to fall back down
  hitCooldown: 1000

fishing-rod-velocity:
  # In 1.9+ fishing rods go 8 blocks instead of 12 blocks
  # This is due to both gravity and initial launch speed
  # Set to true to revert back to the old calculations and gravity

projectile-knockback:
  # This adds knockback and/or damage to players when they get hit by snowballs, eggs & enderpearls
  # This has been a Bukkit bug for so long people thought it was vanilla when it was patched
  # This is the damage done by each projectile
  damage:
    snowball: 0.0001

    #      This means that when you eat *any* apple you start two parallel cooldowns: One for enchanted and one
