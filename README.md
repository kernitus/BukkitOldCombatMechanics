## by kernitus and Rayzr522
A performant Spigot/Paper plugin to configure combat-related mechanics from 1.9 onwards.

## Modesets
Modesets can be configured for your players to choose from. Each modeset can have any combination of the below features enabled, with examples provided to replicate 1.9 vs 1.8 combat. Players can switch between modesets via command, choosing from the modesets allowed for the world they are in.
