Fine‑tune Minecraft combat, movement, and item balance without breaking your server. OldCombatMechanics is a free, open‑source toolkit for Spigot & Paper that lets you mix 1.8‑style snappiness with modern features, per world and per player.

**Why servers pick OCM** ✨
- Modular: enable only what you need: cooldowns, tool damage, knockback, shields, potions, reach, sounds, more.
- Performant: lean listeners only enabled as needed to keep tick time low.
- Modesets: ship different rules for different worlds or players; perfect for mixed PvP/PvE, minigames, or duels.
- Backwards‑friendly: runs on Java 8+, supports 1.9–latest; integrates cleanly with PlaceholderAPI and ProtocolLib.
- Tested for you: live integration tests run real Paper servers across multiple versions every build.
- Zero cost: fully open source, optional basic telemetry (bStats only), no paywalls.

**Quick start** ⚡
1. Drop the jar into `plugins/` (Spigot or Paper-derivatives 1.9+).
2. Restart and edit `config.yml` to pick your modules and modesets.
3. Use `/ocm reload` to apply changes instantly.
4. Hand players `/ocm modeset <name>` to let them choose their ruleset.

## 🧰 Modesets
- Per-player/per-world presets that decide which features are active; each world has an allowed list and a default modeset.
- Let players pick ( `/ocm modeset <name>` ) to run, for example, 1.8-style PvP in an arena world while keeping vanilla rules in survival.

## ⚙ Configurable Features
Features are grouped in `module`s as listed below, and can be individually configured and disabled. Disabled modules will have no impact on server performance.

## 🔌 Compatibility & Testing
OCM targets Spigot 1.9+ and runs on Java 8 and up. It is backed by integration tests that boot real servers on 1.12, 1.19.2, and 1.21.11 each build, so compatibility and behaviour are automatically verified in live environments.
Most plugins will work fine with OCM. Some are explicitly supported, including:
- Placeholder API (see [wiki](https://github.com/kernitus/BukkitOldCombatMechanics/wiki/PlaceholderAPI) for details)

## ⚡ Development Builds
Oftentimes a particular bug fix or feature has already been implemented, but a new version of OCM has not been released
yet. You can find the most up-to-date version of the plugin
on [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/kernitus/OldCombatMechanics/versions?channel=Snapshot&platform=PAPER).
